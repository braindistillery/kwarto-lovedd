#   kwarto-lovedd


##  Intro

An implementation of the board game
[quarto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto_(board_game))
written in C, brought to life by [löve](https://love2d.org).


##  Howto

*   install löve

*   clone (or download and extract) the repository, go to the directory
    containing `main.lua`, and type the command `love .`

*   or, optionally, create a zip file from the directory contents
    and rename it to, say, `kwarto.love`
    (command line: `zip -9r kwarto.love .`),
    and then double-clicking this file is supposed to work

*   yet another possibility is to use
    [ZeroBrane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com):
    open `main.lua`, and from ‘Menu’|‘Project’ choose
    ‘Project Directory’|‘Set From Current File’ and ‘Lua Interpreter’|‘LÖVE’
